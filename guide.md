### **EVEN BUILDING RULE** ⚖️
This is the most important building rule:

**When Building:**
- Houses must be built **evenly** across all properties in a color group
- You cannot have 2 houses on one property if another property in the group has 0
- Correct progression for 3 properties: 1-1-1 → 2-1-1 → 2-2-1 → 2-2-2 → 3-2-2 → etc.
- For hotels: ALL properties must have 4 houses before ANY can get a hotel

**When Selling:**
- Buildings must be sold from properties with the **MOST buildings** first
- This maintains even distribution when downsizing
- Example: With 2-2-1 houses, you can only sell from the properties with 2 houses

### Selling Buildings
- In Sell Mode, click properties with buildings
- Sells one building at a time:
  - Hotel → 4 Houses (hotel removed, 4 houses added)
